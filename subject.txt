Chapter II ObjectivesThis 
project is a surprise.As you are reaching the end of your Common Core, you have 
developed strong adap-tation and problem-solving skills. This project will confront
you with -maybe- unknowntechnologies, intentionally. Once again, you will have to 
adapt, discover, explore, exper-iment to create the expected software.The project includes a 
mandatory part and a series of modules on various topics, asdetailed below in this subject. 
You will be able to choose the modules you want amonga large list, but each module and mandatory 
element contains technical constraints youcannot bypass. So you can select the topics you like, 
but not technologies you like. Thisis a deliberate pedagogical choice.This project is not intended 
to be a portfolio for an incoming internship or other pro-fessional experience. Its purpose is to 
reveal your ability to become acquainted with andcomplete a complex task using an unfamiliar 
technology. This situation will inevitablybe faced during your career, and we aim to develop your 
self-confidence in front of suchsituations.Especially on this big and long project, we encourage 
you to carefully read the en-tire subject, consider several possible strategies, think about your 
design, before startingcoding anything! Some modules may depend on others, some modules may conflict 
withothers. Ft_transcendence will bring many doubts and requires a lot of difficult decisions!
Act wisely :-) Also, this project is definitely a long run, and a wrong path will lead 
you to a huge lossof time. Your project management and team management choices will strongly 
impactyour timeline and results. Many approaches and tools exist to support you on these topics.
Good luck, and have fun playing Pong!


Chapter III AI Instructions●Context
During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different 
tasks. Take the time toexplore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support your 
work. How-ever, always approach them with caution and critically assess the results. Whether 
it’scode, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations, you can never be completely surethat 
your question was well-formed or that the generated content is accurate. Your peersare a valuable 
resource to help you avoid mistakes and blind spots.●Main message☛Use AI to reduce repetitive or 
tedious tasks.
☛Develop prompting skills — both coding and non-coding — that will benefit yourfuture career.
☛Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases,and ethical issues.
☛Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
☛Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibilityfor.
●Learner rules:
	•You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, 
		soyou can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
	•You should reflect on your problem before prompting — this helps you write clearer,
		more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
	•You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing, questioning,and testing 
		anything generated by AI.
	•You should always seek peer review — don’t rely solely on your own validation.


●Phase outcomes:
	•Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
	•Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
	•Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, andcollaboration.
●Comments and examples:
	•You’ll regularly encounter situations — exams, evaluations, and more — whereyou must 
		demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both yourtechnical and interpersonal skills.
	•Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your un-derstanding. 
		Make peer learning a priority.
	•AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic responses. 
		Yourpeers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and accurate insights.
	•Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide alter-native 
		perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality checkpoint.
		
✓Good practice:
	I ask AI: “How do I test a sorting function?” It gives me a few ideas. 
	I try them outand review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.
	
✗Bad practice:
	I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project.  During peer-evaluation, 
	I can’t explain what it does or why. I lose credibility — and I fail myproject.
	
✓Good practice:
	I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catchtwo bugs 
	and rewrite it together — better, cleaner, and fully understood.
	
✗Bad practice:
	I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can’t explain 
	how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail myproject.


Chapter IV Mandatory part

This project is about creating a website for the mightyPongcontest!

IV.1  Overview
	Your software will offer a nice user interface and real-time multiplayer capabilities 
	allowing to play Pong with all your friends!
	
	•At first, your project needs to adhere to the mandatory guidelines as a minimumrequirement 
		(see next section), which will represent only a small portion to the finalgrade.
		
	•The second part of this subject will offer additional modules that can replace orcomplement 
		the mandatory part.
		
	In this subject, you will face words that are highlighted in green.  
	They representtechnology choices that will evolve over time.  
	Be sure to pay close attention to theversion of the subject.
	
	•The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediateand complete solution for an entire 
		feature or a module isprohibited.
		
	•Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of a third-party library or tool 
		must be followed.
	
	•The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple, uniquetask representing a 
		subcomponent of a larger feature or module,is allowed.
		
	•During the evaluation, the team will justify any use oflibrary or tool that is not explicitly 
		approved by the projectguidelines and is not in contradiction with the project’sconstraints.
			
	•During the evaluation, the evaluator will take responsibilityfor determining whether the use 
		of a specific library or toolis legitimate (and allowed) or if it essentially solves 
		anentire feature or module (and is therefore prohibited).
